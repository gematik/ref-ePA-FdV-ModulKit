[#ServiceLocalization]
=== ServiceLocalization

The submodule contains the protocol `ServiceLocatorType` as an entry point to localize ePA service components.,
which - after successful lookup - returns an endpointURL for a given interface name.

The protocol `ServiceLocatorType` is implemented by `ServiceLocator`.
It performs a DNS lookup for retrieving endpoint URLs of various ePA gateway services.
Once the lookup has completed successfully, the  endpoint URLs for the different ePA services can be retrieved.
