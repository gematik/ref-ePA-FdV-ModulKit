[#HealthCardAutn]
=== HealthCardAuthentication

One way to authenticate the individual user for the use of the electronic personal health record
(ePA, elektronische Patientenakte) is using a German Health Card (eGK).

HealthCardAuthn is a class implementing the `Authenticator` protocol
to perform an authentication for the the ePA service.
It has to be instantiated with a `HealthCardType` which usually would be provided by a `CardReaderType`
(see: https://github.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit/[OpenHealthCardKit @ *GitHub*]).

Consider also the working example of an NFC-Demo App, which employs above mentioned frameworks
to communicate with real work (NFC-ready) German Health Cards via the NFC interface provided by Apple:
