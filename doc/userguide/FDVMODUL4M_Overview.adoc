== Overview

The ePA-FdV-module-kit bundles submodules that provide the functionality
(service localization, authentication, authentication via health card, key management)
necessary for the access to  the electronic patient record.
As for now the key management submodule remains unimplemented.
As a reference for each submodule see also the `IntegrationTests`.
